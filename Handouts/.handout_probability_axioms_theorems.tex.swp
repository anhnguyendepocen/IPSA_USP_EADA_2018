\section*{Axioms and theorems of probability - summary}

	(Also know as ``rules of probability'')

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For every event A, $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
		\item $P(S) = 1$
		\item $P(\emptyset) = 0$
		\item  If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then:
	\[P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P (B)\]
		\item  If $A_1$, $A_2$, ... is a sequence of mutually exclusive events, then:
	\[P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P (A_2) + ... + P(A_n)\]
		\item  $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
		\item  $P(A \cup A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$ (because they are mutually exclusive)
		\item $P(A \cap B)$ is the the probability of $A$ \textbf{AND} $B$ happening at the same time.																																																																																																																		
		\item  $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
		\item If A and B are independent events, then $P(A \cap B) = P(A) * P(B)$
		\item If A and B are not independent events, then the conditional probability of A given B, $P(A|B)$, 	is defined as
	\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\]
		\item If A and B are independent events, then $P(A|B) = P(A)$ and the formula
	\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\]
	can be rewritten as (as previously seen)
	\[P(A\cap B) = P(A)*P(B)\]
		\item If A and B are mutually exclusive, then
		\[P(A\cap B) = 0\]
			hence
		 \[P(A|B) = P(B|A) = 0\] 
		\item Law of Total Probability note that we can write the probability of $A$ and $B$ ($A \cap B$ in two different forms:
		 \[P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)\]
		 From that we can derive the law of total probability which states that the probability of $A$ can be separated into two parts: the conditional probability of $A$ on $B$ times the probability of $B$ and the conditional probability of $A$ on the complement of $B$ ($B^c$) times the probability of $B^C$ 
		 \[P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|B^c) * P(B^c)\]

		\item Suppose there are $A_1$, $A_2$,..., $A_n$ events and $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup... \cup A_n$ = S. $A_i$ events are mutually exclusive. Suppose there is another event $B$. For each $A_i$, $B$ has a different joint conditional probability $P(A_i|B)$. $B$ can be described as:
	\[P(B) = P(A_1)*P(B|A_1)+P(A_2)*P(B|A_2)+...+P(A_n)*P(B|A_n)\]
 
	The probability that an specific $A_i$ will occur given B is defined as:
	\[P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(A_i)*P(B|A_i)}{P(A_1)*P(B|A_1)+P(A_2)*P(B|A_2)+...+P(A_n)*P(B|A_n)}\]
	
	\end{enumerate}
