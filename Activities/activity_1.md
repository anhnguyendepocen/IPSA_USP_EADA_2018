# Activity 1 - Basics of probability

Go to the the [G1 visualization of CÃ¢mara dos Deputados](http://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2014/nova-composicao-da-camara.html) after the 2014 election. If you don't speak Portuguese, partner with someone who does (the visualization was too cool and I could not find a similar in English). Write the expression (please, do it in order to train) and find the result for all of the following problems.

- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is from PMDB? 
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is from PMDB and is under 45 years?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is from PMDB or is under 45 years?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is from PMDB and is a woman?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is from PMDB or is under 25 years?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is under 25 years given she/he is from PMDB?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is under 45 years given she/he was part of Dilma's electoral coalition?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is from PMDB and PT and PSDB?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is from PMDB or PT or PSDB?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is a woman given she is from PMDB?
- What is the probability that a Brazilian federal deputy is from PMDB given she is a woman?
- Calculate the probability of being a reelected deputy for each party (you can choose 5 parties for the sake of simplicity). Do you think there 	is independence between party and reelection?
